# GRAPHING YELP DATASET WITH Neo4j AND PYTHON


This project is heavily inspired from [O'Reilly Graph Algorithms](https://neo4j.com/graph-algorithms-book/?ref=home-banner)

### Processing yelp JSONs

Extract and put json files in data folder. So now data folder will have
-yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
-yelp_academic_dataset_user.json
-yelp_academic_dataset_review.json

Then run the script

```
python3 src/process_yelp.py
```
